General Idea:

Many restaurants are now either closed or only offer delivery or curbside pickup.
The idea of this project is to help the restaurants offering curbside pickup. This may be done with a setup where the clients are requested to text the restaurant with their car color/make/model and name under the order.
This can get very overwhelming for small businesses that simply use a single phone (usually the owner's personal cellphone), and end up receiving dozens of texts an hour. 
Organization is incredibly difficult and clumsy.

This is what this project aims to solve.

Using Twilio API for SMS management, this easy-to-access web-based service would greatly assist restaurants during difficult times such as these.
An all-in-one management dashboard for incoming SMS messages to your generated phone # (no more using your personal cell-phone as a restaurant owner!).
Allows the restaurant to know who's still waiting on their order, remove filled-orders, all in a very intuitive system and UI.

Most important, it'll help keeping both clients and employees safe from coronavirus easier and more convenient.

Notes and things to work on:
* Create SMS management system on backend
* Allow the frontend web user to manage many texts at once (all from a generated phone number rather than a personal cell)

Progress:
* Domain name registered: curby.tech - not yet in use
* SMS board functionality implemented
